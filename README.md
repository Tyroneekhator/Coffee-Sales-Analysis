# Coffee-Sales-Analysis

# Project overview
This project aimed to get ad-hoc insights from the CSV file which contains all the transactions of different customers of the "Coffee Sales" chain in America. This was done by cleaning and transforming the data via feature engineering using functions and formulas to answer stakeholder questions and improve business performance.
## Stakeholder questions
- How do sales vary by day of the
week and hour of the day?
- Are there any peak times for sales
activity?
- What is the total sales revenue for
each month?
- How do sales vary across different
store locations?
- what is the average price/order
per person
- Which products are the bestselling in terms of quantity and
revenue?
- How do sales vary by product
category and type?
